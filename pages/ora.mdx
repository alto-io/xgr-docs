# Working With ORA Files

ORA files are also zip files, making it easy to extract the contents and work with them. Simply change the file extension to `.zip` and use the file explorer to see the contents of the ORA file.

The `stack.xml` file contains the metadata for the images, such as pixel offsets and layer names. The `data` folder contains the actual image data, which is stored as PNG files.

## Working with stack.xml

We've found it easier to convert `stack.xml` to JSON, making it more readable and usable in other scripts. We've provided a drag and drop [`XMLToJsonConverter`](https://github.com/alto-io/xgr-docs/blob/main/components/XMLToJsonConverter.js) below.
