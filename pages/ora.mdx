# Generating ORA Files from PSD

## Requirements:
 * [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)

Go to **File --> Export As**, and simply put in a filename with a **.ora** extension. 

***Exporting might take a while***, Depending on the size of your images and number of layers.

    <source src="videos/gimp_export_ora.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>
</video>

### Some suggestions on organizing your PSD:

* Have a layer named Root as the top layer
* Lessen layer depth as much as possible, the simpler the organization is the less code will be needed by devs to process the ORA file
* Make the first part be the default part when items are missing

# Working with ORA Files

ORA files are also zip files, making it easy to extract the contents and work with them. Simply change the file extension to `.zip` and use the file explorer to see the contents of the ORA file.

    <source src="videos/ora_zip.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>

The `stack.xml` file contains the metadata for the images, such as pixel offsets and layer names. The `data` folder contains the actual image data, which is stored as PNG files.

## Working with stack.xml

We've found it easier to convert `stack.xml` to JSON, making it more readable and usable in other scripts. We've provided a drag and drop [`XMLToJsonConverter`](https://github.com/alto-io/xgr-docs/blob/main/components/XMLToJsonConverter.js) below.
